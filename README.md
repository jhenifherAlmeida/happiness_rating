WORLDWIDE HAPPINESS

Introduction

This case study investigates the factors influencing happiness levels across countries, with a particular focus on how international organizations and national governments can improve wellbeing in lower-ranked nations. Leveraging data from the World Happiness Report and complementary socio-economic indicators, our goal was to assess the relative impact of economic, social, and political variables on national happiness scores.
To begin our analysis, we used Python in VS Code to preprocess and consolidate five separate CSV files. This included concatenating datasets, categorizing relevant features (e.g., economic vs. social indicators), and executing comprehensive data cleaning procedures. These steps ensure data consistency, handling missing values, standardized country names, and aligned temporal dimensions across all sources.
Following the data preparation phase, we utilized Python to develop exploratory visualizations that provided an initial understanding of key trends, such as regional differences and factor correlations. These visuals guided the formation of hypotheses and informed the direction of our deeper analysis.
To support advanced querying and relational data modeling, we transitioned to SQL, where we designed a normalized schema and created a set of relational tables based on our cleaned dataset. This structure enabled more complex analytical queries, such as region-specific correlations and time-based comparisons, which revealed nuanced insights into how various factors impact happiness differently across the globe.
By integrating Python-based data wrangling and visualization with SQL-driven relational analysis, we developed a robust foundation for addressing our central research question: How can international organizations or national governments improve happiness in lower-ranked countries?

Problem Statement

How can international organizations or national governments improve happiness in lower-ranked countries?


Hypotheses:

H1: A higher GDP per capita does not always correlate with higher happiness — some countries with high GDP may still rank low in happiness.

H2: Social factors (social support, freedom, generosity, corruption) play a stronger role in long term improvement.

H3: There is a significant difference in average happiness scores between regions.

# Life Expectancy vs Happiness Score
Observations:

Finland shows a noticeable increase in both life expectancy and happiness score, especially from 2017 onwards.
Denmark shows stable happiness scores and a steady rise in life expectancy.
Switzerland and Iceland show slight declines in life expectancy with fairly stable or slightly decreasing happiness scores.
Norway has minor fluctuations in both metrics but generally remains high in happiness with a slight drop in life expectancy in some years.

# Freedom vs Happiness Score
Observations:

Again, Finland stands out with a significant rise in both freedom and happiness scores.
Norway and Denmark show stable or slightly increasing trends in both metrics.
Switzerland and Iceland show flat or declining freedom scores with corresponding mild decreases in happiness.

# Overall Insights Across Both Graphs:
Finland shows consistent growth across life expectancy, freedom, and happiness, suggesting well-rounded development.
Denmark and Norway maintain stable or slightly improving indicators, reflecting continued high quality of life.
Switzerland and Iceland show mild stagnation or decline, possibly indicating areas needing policy attention.


 # Corruption vs Happiness Score
 Observations:

 Finland shows a clear decrease in corruption over time (good governance) and a simultaneous increase in happiness.
 Denmark and Norway maintain relatively low corruption and stable happiness.
 Switzerland and Iceland display slightly higher or stable corruption levels with stagnant or declining happiness scores.

# Generosity vs Happiness Score
 Observations:

Finland again shows a consistent upward trend in both generosity and happiness, highlighting a strong correlation.
Switzerland maintains the highest generosity levels across the period but with slightly declining happiness, suggesting that generosity alone may not be sufficient for happiness.
Denmark and Norway show modest generosity with stable happiness.
Iceland shows relatively lower generosity and flat happiness.

# Overall Comparison Across Both Graphs:
Finland consistently improves across corruption, generosity, and happiness — indicating a well-rounded policy success.
Denmark and Norway maintain high scores through stability and low corruption.
Switzerland and Iceland demonstrate that high generosity or low corruption alone may not guarantee rising happiness — suggesting the need for a balanced approach across factors.


# Challenges in Improving Happiness

Data Limitations: Sometimes there’s data inconsistencies and short term policies may lack immediate impact.

Structural and Geopolitical Barriers: Persistent poverty, weak infrastructure, and inequality .Political instability impacts the effectiveness of policies, which are sometimes constrained by national interests.

One-Size-Doesn’t-Fit-All Policies: Every country has its own unique characteristics, making it impossible to standardize all policies.

# Recommendations
Supporting the economy is essential, as it significantly impacts happiness and encourages investment and development in key areas such as health and social support. As these areas reach a level of sustainability, we also recommend promoting freedom of choice, reducing corruption, and encouraging generosity and support among communities, as these factors have been shown to improve overall happiness.

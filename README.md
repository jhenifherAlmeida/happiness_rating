WORLDWIDE HAPPINESS

Introduction

This case study investigates the factors influencing happiness levels across countries, with a particular focus on how international organizations and national governments can improve wellbeing in lower-ranked nations. Leveraging data from the World Happiness Report and complementary socio-economic indicators, our goal was to assess the relative impact of economic, social, and political variables on national happiness scores.
To begin our analysis, we used Python in VS Code to preprocess and consolidate five separate CSV files. This included concatenating datasets, categorizing relevant features (e.g., economic vs. social indicators), and executing comprehensive data cleaning procedures. These steps ensure data consistency, handling missing values, standardized country names, and aligned temporal dimensions across all sources.
Following the data preparation phase, we utilized Python to develop exploratory visualizations that provided an initial understanding of key trends, such as regional differences and factor correlations. These visuals guided the formation of hypotheses and informed the direction of our deeper analysis.
To support advanced querying and relational data modeling, we transitioned to SQL, where we designed a normalized schema and created a set of relational tables based on our cleaned dataset. This structure enabled more complex analytical queries, such as region-specific correlations and time-based comparisons, which revealed nuanced insights into how various factors impact happiness differently across the globe.
By integrating Python-based data wrangling and visualization with SQL-driven relational analysis, we developed a robust foundation for addressing our central research question: How can international organizations or national governments improve happiness in lower-ranked countries?

Problem Statement

How can international organizations or national governments improve happiness in lower-ranked countries?


Hypotheses:
Economic factors (GDP, employment) have the strongest correlation with happiness.
Social factors (freedom, trust, generosity) play a stronger role in long-term improvement.
There is a significant difference in average happiness scores between regions.
The effect of corruption perception on happiness varies significantly by continent.
Political stability’s impact on happiness is stronger in regions with lower average democratic index scores


Challenges in Improving Happiness

Data Limitations: Sometimes there’s data inconsistencies and short term policies may lack immediate impact.

Structural and Geopolitical Barriers: Persistent poverty, weak infrastructure, and inequality .Political instability impacts the effectiveness of policies, which are sometimes constrained by national interests.

One-Size-Doesn’t-Fit-All Policies: Every country has its own unique characteristics, making it impossible to standardize all policies.
Recommendations
Supporting the economy is essential, as it significantly impacts happiness and encourages investment and development in key areas such as health and social support. As these areas reach a level of sustainability, we also recommend promoting freedom of choice, reducing corruption, and encouraging generosity and support among communities, as these factors have been shown to improve overall happiness.
